# false_in.test tests that the correct error-code is used for an in-program
# that trivially fails to run.
#
# The in-program with false comes first to cause that to fail first.
#
# Note that both the out-program and the first in-program should fail to run
# since the out-program will try to echo to a broken pipe.
