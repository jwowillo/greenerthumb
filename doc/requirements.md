# `greenerthumb` Requirements

1. Each hardware component must be optional.
2. Sense:
    a. Air temperature and humidity.
    b. Soil moisture.
3. Publish sensed data on a connected network.
4. Log sensed data from the network.
5. Plot sensed data from the network.

## Future Requirements

  network is below a user set threshold.
* Water plants when the soil moisture from the network is below the user set
  threshold.
* Make sensors wireless.
* Provided IC packages for sensors.
* Monitor networks.
* Allow plots to be saved.
* Remove bad sensed data.
* Provide a web interface.
* Discover addresses and ports automatically.
* Provide installation tools.
* Implement a log processor.
* Clean error handling.
* Improve documentation.
* Improve tests.
* Automate reconnecting in `bullhorn`.
