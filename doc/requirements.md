# `greenerthumb` Requirements

1. Each hardware component must be optional.
2. Sense:
    * Air temperature and humidity.
    * Soil moisture.
3. Publish sensed data on a connected network.
4. Log sensed data from the network.
5. Plot sensed data from log files.

## Future Requirements

* Sense soil pH.
* Plot sensed data from the network in real time.
* Push a notification to a connected phone when the soil moisture from the
  network is below a user set threshold.
* Water plants when the soil moisture from the network is below the user set
  threshold.
* Make sensors wireless.
