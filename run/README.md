# `run`

`run` contains implementations of runners for components.

## Documentation

* `make` in the 'doc' directory generates PDF documentation.

## Building

* `make <component>` from the 'Makefile' in the project root will build
  everything for the component.

## Running

Before running, `util/activate.sh` must be sourced from the project root after
building the right component. After that, running instructions are included in
the 'README.md' in the build directory.
